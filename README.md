Anomaly Detection in Engagement Patterns on Instagram, as addressed in focuses on identifying irregularities in user interactions. This topic becomes particularly relevant
following the work on missing link prediction in Instagram's user network, where limited data on links presented unique challenges. The goal is to develop methods that not only detect the anomalies but also contextualize them within the dynamic social landscape of Instagram. This involves navigating through the vast
and varied data, distinguishing between genuine and artificial engagement, and understanding the implications of these anomalies in the broader context of social media dynamics.
